# homonym-helper-js
(JavaScript, Node.js) A program to check a text file to see if you've accidentally used a homonym of the word you intended to use. (e.g. there / their / they're; you're / your) This is another go at one of my [side projects](https://github.com/seeksort/homonym-helper) previously attempted in Python.
